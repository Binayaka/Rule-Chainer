# Rule-Chainer
This is an implementation of a rule chaining framework, meant to replace long if-else spaghetti statements with readable, meaningful code.
Some of the features are

 * Chain multiple rules
 * Execute them all at once
 * Request and get access to the result of the last rule
 * Execute all the rules in one neat go.
